### Hi there 👋

My name is Gjin Rexhaj, and I'm a second-year university student majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I'm also an incoming firmware engineer intern this summer.

Take a look around! You can find all of my personal programming projects on this Github.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a fractal generator app built in Java, as well as a graphing calculator in Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning vanilla Java (as well as swing and awt), and Python. Possibly looking into learning Kotlin and maybe C++
